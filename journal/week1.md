# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

- I created a github repository using the template provide
- I connect git pod to my repository
- I installed all dependecies for the front and backend and able to run the app locally
- I created s Dockerfile for the frontend app - (passed the environmental variables in the dockerfile)
- I created s Dockerfile for the backend app - (passed the environmental variables in the dockerfile)
- I created image of the backend and run it without passing the env flag on the command line
- I created image of the frontend and run it without passing the env flag on the command line
-I created a docker compose file to run both frontend and backend image as a container
-I expanded the docker compose file to include postgress database and dynamodb
- I created notification endpoint and register in in the app.py file and app.js file so they can communicate.

- It has been an interesting week and i wouldn't have been able to achieved this on my own but for the guidance provided by Adrew and other tutor that volunteered to help us grow.

- I want to appreciate one of my colleague that is always ready to support when i face challenges in the person of "Djaballah Mohammed Djedid".

- I watched all the video guide for this week, it has been an eye opener for me

- I am exposed to new tools like "openapi" and "readme.com"

- I added a file "newexp.md" to document new applications i am exposed to

- I didn't envisaged it will take this long for me to settled in. It has been an interesting journey so far.
